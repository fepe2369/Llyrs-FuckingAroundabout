              My name is <b class="selected">Llŷr</b>, I am a Uruguayan dude
              currently studying computer engineering. My idea is to use this
              space to yap about music, art, culture, philosophy, politics,
              history, literature, science and programming; basically, stuff I
              find interesting and enjoying :3

                <p>Die erste... It means “the first one” in German btw. This is the first post in this section, hopefully, as I add more stuff it won't all break down on my end, I made the blog by myself with blood sweat and javascript, so.... the code isn't very pretty but I mean... It fkn works right?, at least for now xd. <br /><br />So anyways, as an example for now I will share with you a message I wrote at the age of 16 while high on <span class="selected">apple-flavored ADES</span> (yeah, that weirdly delicious juice), originally in Spanish but translated it goes like this: <br /><br /> <i> ‘So... we can say that from a mathematical philosophical point of view, life and the meaning we give it is nothing but a homothety of a polyhedron with infinite sides, where our opinion is based on a reason, the same being a natural number within an infinite set. <br />Our view of things will be reflected in the distance from the centre of the homothety to the X', dictated by the corresponding ratio. Given the different reasons, the polyhedron of infinite sides will not be represented faithfully and proportionately, but will create a totally different figure, resulting in the very essence of the soul and the ego, each being merely a figure...’. </i> <br /><br /> <b>~ yeah, definitely high on that apple juice.</b></p>

                <p>Sometimes, it’s like we’re professional idiots, finding genius in making our nonsense look totally legit. There’s that odd satisfaction in doing something utterly ridiculous but feeling like it was the most logical move ever. <br /><br /> <b> Kinda like wearing a cape to buy bread—completely unnecessary, but somehow, it just feels like you’re on the right track. </b></p>
